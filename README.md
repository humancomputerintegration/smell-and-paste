# Smell & Paste toolkit

This is a repository for the Smell & Paste low-fidelity prototyping toolkit for olfactory experiences, which was presented at ACM CHI 2023. The device is in fact a 3-channel olfactory interface created by [Jas Brooks](https://jasbrooks.net) and [Pedro Lopes](https://plopes.org) at the University of Chicago's [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/).

**Original Paper Abstract:** Low-fidelity prototyping is so foundational to Human-Computer Interaction, appearing in most early design phases. So, how do experts prototype olfactory experiences? We interviewed eight experts and found that _they do not_ because _no process supports this_. Thus, we engineered Smell & Paste, a low-fidelity prototyping toolkit. Designers assemble olfactory proofs-of-concept by pasting scratch-and-sniff stickers onto a paper tape. Then, they test the interaction by advancing the tape in our 3D-printed (or cardboard) cassette, which releases the smells via scratching. Our toolkit uses commodity materials; keeps iterations quick, approachable, and cheap; and circumvents electronics, programming, and chemical handling. We evaluated Smell & Paste in two studies. We found that the toolkit was approachable to people of any technical background and that novices and experts appropriated and extended the toolkit, making it personalized. Novices produced prototypes quickly, and experts were excited about the kit's technical affordances and integrating it into their practice.


## Putting together a kit

### 3D Printed version

`3D_Print` contains all the files for the 3D printed version of the cassette. It contains both the parametric Fusion 360 file (`Cassette_3dPrinted_v69.f3d`) as well as all the STL files for printing off the bat (`\STL`). You will have to print two of the rollers (`SaP_Nylon_Roller.stl`) and spools (`SaP_Nylon_Spool.stl`) for one cassette.

Please consider sourcing materials from local stores instead of Amazon, if you can! A lot of these items can be found in your home, hardware stores, general stores, and stationary stores.

All 3D printed parts do not need any support structures except for the spools (and - even then - could probably do fine without).

### Cardboard version

`Cardboard` contains all the files for the cardboard version of the cassette. It contains one version for lasercutters (`\Lasercut`) and one for manual cutting using an Xacto knife (`\Manual`). Please note that if you are lasercutting the cardboard version, you will have to leave the pieces to ventilate so that there is no residual burn odor (you can also adjust the settings to decrease burning as much as possible, and can also put the pieces with an ozone generator to speed up the deodorization). For manual cutting, print out the pages (PDF) and paste them on 2.5 mm cardboard. Then use an exacto knife to follow lines.

### Sourcing scratch-and-sniff stickers

For our toolkit to be practical, you'll need scratch-and-sniff stickers. Commercial scratch-and-sniff stickers for children are incredibly accessible and cheap, including good and bad scents. We created a dataset of 800 scratch-and-sniff stickers from 22 brands to facilitate sticker selection. We manually extracted each sticker’s scent, dimensions, and price per cm2. The dataset includes (nominally) 538 unique scents, depicting a wide variety at costs as low as 0.00035 USD per cm2. [You can find its CSV here!](https://github.com/humancomputerintegration/smell-and-paste/blob/main/CommercialSaS_v00.csv) (Jas recommends Just For Laughs' [Stink Factory stickers](https://www.thestinkfactory.com/) for their variety and price.)
