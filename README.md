# Smell & Paste toolkit

This is a repository for the Smell & Paste low-fidelity prototyping toolkit for olfactory experiences, which was presented at ACM CHI 2023. The device is in fact a 3-channel olfactory interface created by Jas Brooks and Pedro Lopes at the University of Chicago's [Human Computer Integration Lab](https://lab.plopes.org/).

**Original Paper Abstract:** Low-fidelity prototyping is so foundational to Human-Computer Interaction, appearing in most early design phases. So, how do experts prototype olfactory experiences? We interviewed eight experts and found that _they do not_ because _no process supports this_. Thus, we engineered Smell & Paste, a low-fidelity prototyping toolkit. Designers assemble olfactory proofs-of-concept by pasting scratch-and-sniff stickers onto a paper tape. Then, they test the interaction by advancing the tape in our 3D-printed (or cardboard) cassette, which releases the smells via scratching. Our toolkit uses commodity materials; keeps iterations quick, approachable, and cheap; and circumvents electronics, programming, and chemical handling. We evaluated Smell & Paste in two studies. We found that the toolkit was approachable to people of any technical background and that novices and experts appropriated and extended the toolkit, making it personalized. Novices produced prototypes quickly, and experts were excited about the kit's technical affordances and integrating it into their practice.
